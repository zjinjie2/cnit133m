        <h2>
            PhoneGap (or PhoneGap Build) with Cordova, Flutter, and React Native are all frameworks used
            for developing cross-platform mobile applications. Each of these frameworks has its own set
            of strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them often depends on specific project
            requirements and developer preferences.

        <h3>Performance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>PhoneGap:</b> PhoneGap might make your app a bit slower. But for many apps, the speed
                is still good enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flutter:</b> Flutter is also fast. It makes your app start quickly, has smooth
                animations, and works well with complex user interfaces.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>React Native:</b> React Native makes your app run fast by using native components. This
                gives your app a smooth and fast feel, like a native app.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>User Interface:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>PhoneGap:</b> PhoneGap uses web technologies, and you can make good-looking interfaces,
                but they might feel more like web pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flutter:</b> Flutter gives you a lot of freedom to make your app look just the way you
                want. It has a lot of ready-to-use pieces and allows for beautiful designs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>React Native:</b> React Native makes your app look like a native app. It has many
                pre-built pieces that make it easy to create good-looking and easy-to-use interfaces.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Community Support:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>PhoneGap:</b> PhoneGap has good community support, especially since Adobe took over.
                You can find a lot of resources and help from other developers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flutter:</b> Flutter is newer, but its community is growing fast. You can find a lot of
                help and extra things made by other developers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>React Native:</b> React Native has a big community of developers. This is good because
                you can find a lot of help, updates, and extra pieces made by other developers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Code Reusability:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>PhoneGap:</b> PhoneGap lets you reuse code from web applications. You can use your
                existing web code, which saves time and effort.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flutter:</b> Flutter also lets you write one code that works on different platforms.
                This makes it easy to reuse your code and saves you from doing the same work twice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>React Native:</b> With React Native, you can write your code once and use it on both
                iOS and Android. This makes it easier to keep your app updated and saves time.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Cost-efficiency:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>PhoneGap:</b> PhoneGap is cost-efficient because it allows you to reuse code from web
                applications, reducing development time and costs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flutter:</b> Flutter is cost-effective because it reduces the time and effort needed
                for development with its single codebase.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>React Native:</b> React Native is cost-effective because you can write code once and
                use it on different platforms. This saves development time and costs.
            </li>
